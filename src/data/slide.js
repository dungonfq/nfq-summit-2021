    content: `I very much enjoyed the event. It was nice meeting other company members, chat about their experiences with NFQ and exchange ideas on how to improve your own remote team set-up.
    The organisations by the NFQ team was marvelous. We participated in the motorroller tour to the Mekong river delta, I got a Vietnamese massage, learned how to cook a few Vietnamese dishes in an amazing setting with a super nice chef, and got to spend time with my team. Not to speak of the great New Year celebration we all enjoyed in our beautiful tailor-made áo dài as an end to our journey to Vietnam!
    Overall, NFQ did an amazing job balancing speeches and content program points with social events that helped to connect NFQ clients. I am looking forward to attending the program next year again!`,

    content: `NFQ has put together a remarkably different summit that has exceeded all expectations. This event sets standards that are not only hard to beat, but also hard to copy. Because one thing is clear - NFQ is not a standard service provider, NFQ is a team that shows passion in all areas.<br/>Outstanding event, wonderful people and an extremely professional company. I can recommend everyone to take a closer look at this company and to attend a NFQ Summit.`,
